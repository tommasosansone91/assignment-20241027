# my TODO

- add error ocdes for response api: mapping the errors.

- they will run test scenarios based on the api I was told to build

- delete must delete the verison of joke
- is active must be changed to model joke_version
- the querues must be changed

- the update api must use the get api by id to get the joke
if it does not mtch it, returns error. -> done
it if matches it, 
first it must flag it as deleted, not active (the verison!)
then it must publish a new version of it (active) ---> create a new joke
keep the joke model as it is the only way to keep the history of "versions of the jokes"
